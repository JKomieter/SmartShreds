# SmartShreds
Make your file duplication detector with semantic similarity analysis:

# Description: 
This is a Rust-based file duplicate detector with a twist! It goes beyond identifying identical files and analyzes their semantic similarity to find content with similar meaning but potentially different wording.

# Key Features:

* Content-based duplicate detection using hashing algorithms.
* Semantic similarity analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries.
* Actionable suggestions:
    - Merge files with highly similar content.
    - Repurpose content for a different format based on semantic analysis.
    - Highlight key differences between similar files.

# Benefits:

Saves storage space by eliminating unnecessary duplicates.
Improves information management by finding conceptually similar content.
Identifies opportunities to repurpose existing content for new uses.


Duplicate File Finder: Continue with your current functionality of finding duplicate files. You can enhance this by not just comparing file sizes, but also comparing file contents to ensure they are truly duplicates.

File Type Analyzer: Add functionality to analyze and categorize files based on their type. For example, you can categorize files into images, videos, documents, etc.

Storage Analyzer: Analyze how storage is being used. For example, calculate what percentage of storage is being used by each file type.

File History Tracker: Track changes to files over time. This could include when files are created, modified, or deleted.

File Recovery: Implement a feature to recover deleted files, if possible.

File Compression: Add a feature to compress rarely used files to save storage space.

File Encryption: Add a feature to encrypt sensitive files for security.

User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the tool. This could be a command-line interface, a web interface, or a desktop application.

Testing and Documentation: Write comprehensive tests for your application and document all features thoroughly.

This project would give you experience with a wide range of programming concepts, including file I/O, system calls, data analysis, user interface design, testing, and documentation. It would also be a useful tool that could help users understand and manage their file systems more effectively.
