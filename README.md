# SmartShreds
Make your file duplication detector with semantic similarity analysis:

# Description: 
This is a Rust-based file duplicate detector with a twist! It goes beyond identifying identical files and analyzes their semantic similarity to find content with similar meaning but potentially different wording.

# Key Features:

* Content-based duplicate detection using hashing algorithms.
* Semantic similarity analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries.
* Actionable suggestions:
    - Merge files with highly similar content.
    - Repurpose content for a different format based on semantic analysis.
    - Highlight key differences between similar files.

# Benefits:

Saves storage space by eliminating unnecessary duplicates.
Improves information management by finding conceptually similar content.
Identifies opportunities to repurpose existing content for new uses.
